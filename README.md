# Extension Analyzer

This repository contains the code used to analyze the extension ecosystems of PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, SQLite, Redis, and DuckDB. The code for each of these systems and the instructions on how to run the analysis scripts can be found in their respective directories. Additionally, we have included our the CSVs
used to run our plot scripts and our matplotlib scripts in these directories as well.

Feel free to submit PRs and offer feedback, we would love to hear it!
