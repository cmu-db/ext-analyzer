# Plot Scripts
This directory contains the scripts used to generate the plots in our paper.

There are two scripts:
- `plots.py`: generates the histograms and bar graphs
- `compatibility_hot_graph.py`: generates the compatibility hot graph (Figure 5 in the paper)

To run these scripts, `python3 plots.py` and `python3 compatibility_hot_graph.py` should work as intended. The scripts' dependencies are `matplotlib` and `pandas`.
